# ⚡ Zepplin

> A lightweight, blazing-fast package manager and self-hosted registry for the Zig ecosystem.

Zepplin is your minimal, high-performance companion for managing Zig projects and packages. Designed to bring the convenience of `cargo` and the scalability of Kellnr to Zig, Zepplin helps developers stay focused on performance and simplicity — just like Zig itself.

**🎉 WORKING PROTOTYPE - ALL THREE COMPONENTS IMPLEMENTED!**
- ✅ CLI Package Manager
- ✅ Self-Hosted Registry Server  
- ✅ Beautiful Web Interface
- ✅ Docker Support

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd zepplin
./dev.sh build

# Start the registry server
./dev.sh serve

# In another terminal, use the CLI
./dev.sh run init                    # Initialize a new project
./dev.sh run add xev                 # Add a package
./dev.sh run publish                 # Publish to registry
```

---

## 🔧 CLI Commands

```bash
zepplin init               # Bootstrap a new Zig project with zepplin.toml
zepplin add xev            # Add a package from the registry
zepplin add xev@1.2.0      # Add a specific version
zepplin update             # Update all dependencies
zepplin build              # Run zig build + dependency resolution
zepplin publish            # Package and push to the registry
zepplin login [registry]   # Authenticate with your registry
zepplin serve [port]       # Start the registry server (default: 8080)
zepplin browse             # Browse packages by category
zepplin trending           # Show trending packages
```

---

## 🌐 Self-Hosted Registry

Zepplin includes a built-in registry server with a beautiful web interface:

### Features
- **🎨 Modern Web UI** - Browse packages with a sleek, dark-themed interface
- **🔍 Real-time Search** - Find packages instantly
- **📊 Usage Statistics** - Track downloads and package metrics
- **🔐 Authentication** - Secure package publishing
- **🚀 RESTful API** - Full API for programmatic access
- **📦 Package Management** - Upload, version, and manage packages

### Web Interface
Visit `http://localhost:8080` after starting the server to access the web interface with:
- Package browser and search
- Download statistics
- Package details and documentation
- User management (coming soon)

### API Endpoints
```
GET  /                           # Web interface
GET  /api/packages               # List all packages
GET  /api/packages/{name}        # Get package details
POST /api/packages               # Publish a package (requires auth)
GET  /api/search?q={query}       # Search packages
```

---

## � Docker Deployment

### Quick Docker Run
```bash
# Build and run with Docker
./dev.sh docker-build
./dev.sh docker-run 8080

# Or manually
docker build -t zepplin .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v zepplin-data:/data zepplin
```

### Production with Docker Compose
```bash
# Start the full stack (registry + nginx)
docker-compose --profile production up -d

# Development mode (registry only)
docker-compose up -d
```

The Docker setup includes:
- **Multi-stage builds** for minimal image size
- **Health checks** for reliability
- **Volume persistence** for package data
- **Nginx reverse proxy** with rate limiting and caching
- **Non-root user** for security

## 📋 Development

### Prerequisites
- Zig 0.16.0 or later
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Build and test
./dev.sh build
./dev.sh test

# Run CLI commands
./dev.sh run help
./dev.sh run init

# Start development server
./dev.sh serve 3000

# Clean build artifacts
./dev.sh clean
```
